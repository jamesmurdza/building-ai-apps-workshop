# Building AI Apps

## About me

- I've been a software engineer for most of my life.
- I worked for a bunch of different startups and now I'm mainly a teacher focused on idea-to-MVP.
- I also made an AI code editor: https://gitwit.dev/

## Streaming ðŸ“¹

- I stream with StreamYard. There's a limit of 10 people on the video channel. I can have unlimited people in the comments.
- Don't put anything on the stream you wouldn't want public on the internet.

## Plan for today

- Brainstorm ideas for AI apps we can build
- Tips from my own experience building AI apps
- Do an example together!
- You'll all get free OpenAI credits you can use for the rest of the week

## Tips for building with AI ðŸ¤–

- There are many APIs out there and libraries (Python, TypeScript, etc.) for interacting with APIs.
- The major LLM companies host their own APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Mistral
- There are also API providers for open source APIs: Together AI, Replicate, Groq

### Evaluating LLMs

- In the past six months, open source LLMs and alternatives to OpenAI have made huge leaps forward.
- The best overall comparison is the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.lmsys.org/).
- Whenever you have a specific usecase, you'll want to run your own evaluations.

## Tips for building full-stack ðŸ¥ž

- I've been trying everything: [jamesmurdza/building-resources](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/building-resources/)

## Example project

- I'm building a site where you can log in and pay to make image generations.
- I started by using Vercel's admin dashboard template: [Deploy NextJS + PostgreSQL apps for free with Vercel](https://youtu.be/EynGNuFtKeI)
- Then, I added backend routes for OpenAI, and pages to generate and analyze images.
- Link to my example project: [jamesmurdza/nextjs-postgres-openai-starter](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/nextjs-postgres-openai-starter)

### Future ideas

- Customize and add your own prompts!
- Save generated images to the logged in user's account.
- Integrate payments like in [vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments)
