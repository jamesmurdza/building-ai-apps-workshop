# Building AI Apps

## About me

- I've been a software engineer for most of my life.
- I worked for a bunch of different startups and now I'm mainly a teacher focused on idea-to-MVP.
- I also made an AI code editor: https://gitwit.dev/

## Streaming ðŸ“¹

- I stream with StreamYard. There's a limit of 10 people on the video channel. I can have unlimited people in the comments.
- Don't put anything on the stream you wouldn't want public on the internet.

## Plan for today

- Brainstorm ideas for AI apps we can build
- Tips from my own experience building AI apps
- Do an example together!
- You'll all get free OpenAI credits you can use for the rest of the week

## Tips for building with AI ðŸ¤–

- There are many APIs out there and libraries (Python, TypeScript, etc.) for interacting with APIs.
- The major LLM companies host their own APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Mistral
- There are also API providers for open source APIs: Together AI, Replicate, Groq

### Evaluating LLMs

- In the past six months, open source LLMs and alternatives to OpenAI have made huge leaps forward.
- The best overall comparison is the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.lmsys.org/).
- Whenever you have a specific usecase, you'll want to run your own evaluations.
